I assume you have java already installed on your machine so Please follow the instructions to start with gradle scripts.
first as usual download the gradle package or zip from below link 
https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-gradle/archive/master.zip
or if you are an android developer then u already have that in this location 
C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\gradle\gradle-2.14.1 
or somewhere you choose to install the setup. so 
go ahead and set the environment variable first here 
Control Panel\System and Security\System - >advance system settings->environment variable->
in the system variables choose "path" and click on edit and paste the gradle install location in the end
okeh I know you guys have did this before but still i gotta tell you.
now check if gradle is installed or not 
simple type in cmd "gradle" and you will see this
